## Abstract
Facial pain can be a severely debilitating disease. Although the etiologies of facial pain are varied, facial pain commonly results in diminished quality of life and a pronounced psychosocial burden. To determine whether these effects are associated with an increased risk of suicide, we performed a retrospective review of patient encounters at our institution that contained a diagnostic code for facial pain. Data were obtained from patients who completed the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and Brief Pain Inventory-Facial (BPI-Facial) during their clinical course, which assess suicidal risk and the impact of facial pain on quality of life, respectively. We identified 181 patients with facial pain who met the inclusion criteria. The most common etiology of facial pain was trigeminal neuralgia (78.5%), followed by atypical facial pain (8.8%). Within our cohort, 13.3% of patients reported some degree of suicidal ideation in the C-SSRS questionnaire, a rate ~3x higher than the estimated prevalence in the general adult population. This heightened risk of suicide was associated with considerable pain-related impairments reported in the BPI-Facial scale, particularly with respect to the pain intensity and interference with general activities domains (p < 0.01). Our results suggest that facial pain can have highly detrimental effects on patient well-being. Comprehensive longitudinal screening and targeted interventions may be warranted to mitigate the heightened risk of suicide.  

The results are reported in Campbell et al., XXXX.
